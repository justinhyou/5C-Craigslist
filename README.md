5C-Craigslist
=================
Summary
-------
Among the five colleges that compose the Claremont Colleges, many students utilize various facebook groups and other communication platforms (such as campus-wide emails) to sell dorm room items, ranging from furniture to class books. Much waste is generated as these various platforms are not accessible to every student, and the difficulty of scheduling actual transitions prevent students from selling their items and rather ends up in the garbage disposal. This web app allows Claremont College students to better connect with each other.
